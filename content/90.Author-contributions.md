## Author contributions
JGM was assigned last author as the project initiator and leader. 
RLM was assigned second to last author based on their leadership role in curating all sections. 
All other authors were ordered by estimating their contributions using a quantitative score. 
The score for each author was a sum of the number of sentences added plus 33 lines for each figure added. 
Scores were adjusted for confounding factors, such as split contributions between multiple contributors. 
Authors with similar scores were assigned equal contributions.
