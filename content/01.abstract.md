## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Proteomics is the large scale study of protein structure and function from biological systems through protein identification and quantification.
"Shotgun proteomics" or "bottom-up proteomics" is the prevailing strategy, in which proteins are hydrolyzed into peptides that are analyzed by mass spectrometry.
Proteomics studies can be applied to diverse studies ranging from simple protein identification to studies of proteoforms, protein-protein interactions, protein structural alterations, absolute and relative protein quantification, post-translational modifications, and protein stability. 
To enable this range of different experiments, there are diverse strategies for proteome analysis. 
The nuances of how proteomic workflows differ may be challenging to understand for new practitioners. 
Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of different proteomics methods.
We cover from biochemistry basics and protein extraction to biological interpretation and orthogonal validation. 
We expect this manuscript will serve as a handbook for researchers who are new to the field of bottom-up proteomics.
